Time to dig into our garden bed domain model. Let's start with the following user needs to anchor on to

> I need to be able to plan out where I want things to go in my raised beds, well in advance of the plants actually going into the ground

> I'd like to embrace the square-foot garden concept

> I'd like to ensure I put my plants in the place that's best for them

These are intentionally vague statements. Dometimes your domain experts will use terminology that you don't understand, or that's insufficiently precise to build software around. Part of your job is to ask clarifying questions and help drive a discussion that leads toward deeper understanding and **refinement of knowledge**.

## Your task

Discuss the related statements above with your domain expert. If you'd like, use the same LLM as before as your expert!
