# Testing commands that are expected to stay running until cancelled
* Use the unix `timeout` (`gtimeout` on macos) command, so that they don't stay running forever 
* Choose a wait time that makes it very likely a success or failure will surface before the `timeout` command cancels it
```sh
timeout 10s <command>
```
